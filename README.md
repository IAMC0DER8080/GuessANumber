# GuessANumber

We tried binary search efficiency with simple fun console game of guessing a number with 8 yes/no questions.
Currently we can guess any number between 0 to 100 with 6 to 8 questions. This app currently limmited to console only.

End Goal to guess any number from 0 to 100 by only 6 questions with GUI.
